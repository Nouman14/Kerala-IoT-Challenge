# Kerala-IoT-Challenge

> Foxlab Makerspace in association with GTech - Group of Technology Companies in Kerala is launching our prestigious program “Kerala IoT Challenge 2021”, with a vision to mould 100 IoT experts in Kerala, hosting on the µLearn platform. Kerala IoT Challenge is a program designed in 4 levels followed by a hackathon to identify and train quality industry leaders in the IoT domain, while any novice learner can start with layer 1 and others can enter laterally to the desired layer after an evaluation.
# About Me
> Hi everyone! I’m Nouman N, 4'th year Electronics and Communication student from Eranad Knowledge City Technical Campus, Manjeri. I also a Diploma holder in Electronics. I’m here to explore new dimensions of the IoT world.And I also interested in Cyber Security

# Experiment 1 - Hello World LED Blinking

> A basic Program similar to printing "*Hello World* " in any programming language. The Aim is to blink an LED using **Arduino Uno Board**.

> Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc. It has several advantages over the conventional microcontrollers. It comes with a pre-tested software and hardware libraries and has its own integrated development environment (IDE). Also it is less expensive & beginner friendly.

## Components Required  
* Arduino Uno Board 
* USB Cable 
* LED (Any Color) x 1 Nos
* 220 OHM Resistor X 1 Nos
* Breadboard 
* Jumper Wires (Male to Male ) X 2 Nos

void setup()
{
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);// define pin with LED connected as output.
}
void loop()
{
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // set the LED on.
delay(1000); // wait for a second.
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // set the LED off.
delay(1000); // wait for a second
}

```

## Output

Actually, these two experiments are similar. While in this traffic lights experiment, we use 3 LEDs with different colors rather than 1 LED.

## Components Required 

* Arduino board *1
* USB cable *1
* Red M5 LED*1

pinMode(yellowled, OUTPUT); // set the pin with yellow LED as “output”
pinMode(greenled, OUTPUT); // set the pin with green LED as “output”
}
void loop()
{
digitalWrite(greenled, HIGH);//// turn on green LED
delay(5000);// wait 5 seconds
digitalWrite(greenled, LOW); // turn off green LED
for(int i=0;i<3;i++)// blinks for 3 times
{
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(yellowled, HIGH);// turn on yellow LED
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(yellowled, LOW);// turn off yellow LED
} 
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(redled, HIGH);// turn on red LED
delay(5000);// wait 5 seconds

}

```

## Output

# Experiment 7 - LDR Light Sensor

> An experiment to understand the working of an LDR light Sensor.

## LDR : Light Dependent Sensor

> Photo Resistor (Photovaristor) is a resistor whose resistance varies from different incident light strength. It's based on the photoelectric effect of semiconductor. If the incident light is intense, its resistance reduces; if the incident light is weak, the resistance increases.

![schema_Myt5vqqplZ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91405741/138436635-60cb2ec4-091d-4f24-bf96-b0289e06fa00.png)

## Procedure

* Connect the 3.3v output of the Arduino to the positive rail of the breadboard
* Connect the ground to the negative rail of the breadboard
* Place the LDR on the breadboard
* Attach the 10K resistor to one of the legs of the LDR
* Connect the A0 pin of the Arduino to the same column where the LDR and resistor is connected (Since the LDR gives out an analog voltage, it is connected to the analog input pin on the Arduino. The Arduino, with its built-in ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), then converts the analog voltage from 0-5V into a digital value in the range of 0-1023). - Now connect the other end of the 10K resistor to the negative rail
* And the the second (free) leg of the LDR to the positive rail
Pretty much this is what we need for the light sensing. Basic circuits like this can be done without an Arduino aswell. However, if you want to log the values and use it to create charts, run other logics etc. I will recomend an Arduino or ESP8266 or may be a ESP32 for this.
Now, as we want our circuit to do something in the real world other than just displaying the values on the computer screen we will be attaching a LED to the circuit. The LED will turn on when its dark and will go off when its bright. To achieve this we will:
* Place the LED on the breadboard
* Connect the 220ohm resistor to the long leg (+ve) of the LED
* Then we will connect the other leg of the resistor to pin number 13 (digital pin) of the Arduino
* and the shorter leg of the LED to the negative rail of the breadboard

## Code

```

const int ledPin = 13;
const int ldrPin = A0;
void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(ldrPin, INPUT);
}
void loop() {
int ldrStatus = analogRead(ldrPin);
if (ldrStatus <= 200) {
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
Serial.print("Its DARK, Turn on the LED : ");
Serial.println(ldrStatus);
} else {
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
Serial.print("Its BRIGHT, Turn off the LED : ");
Serial.println(ldrStatus);
}
}

```

# Experiment 8 : Flame Sensor

> An experiment to understand the working of an Flame sensor.

## Flame Sensor

 **Usage**:These types of sensors are used for short range fire detection and can be used to monitor projects or as a safety precaution to cut devices off / on.

 **Range**:I have found this unit is mostly accurate up to about 3 feet.

 **How it works**:The flame sensor is very sensitive to IR wavelength at 760 nm ~ 1100 nm light.

**Analog output (A0)**: Real-time output voltage signal on the thermal resistance.

**Digital output (D0)**: When the temperature reaches a certain threshold, the output high and low signal threshold adjustable via potentiometer.

**Pins:**

* VCC - Positive voltage input: 5v for analog 3.3v for Digital.

* A0 - Analog output

* D0 - Digital output

* GND -  Ground
